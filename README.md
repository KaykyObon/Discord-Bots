# Discord Bots Repository

Welcome to my collection of Discord bots. This repository contains various custom bots built for different use cases on Discord servers.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a central place to store and share open-source Discord bots that I have developed. All bots in this repository are designed to be easy to set up, customizable, and ready for use by anyone.

Whether you're looking for moderation tools, automation helpers, or custom utilities, you'll find bots here that you can clone, run, and adapt to your own server needs.

## How to Use

Each bot is stored in its own subfolder with clear documentation (usually a README.md) explaining:

* What the bot does
* How to configure and run it
* Any required permissions or setup steps

Feel free to explore, modify, and use the bots for your own projects.

## Contributions

If you'd like to suggest improvements or contribute your own bot, feel free to open a pull request or submit an issue.

Happy botting!
